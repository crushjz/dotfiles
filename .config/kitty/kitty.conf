#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘).

#: Simple shortcut mapping is done with the map directive. For full
#: details on advanced mapping including modal and per application
#: maps, see mapping <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/>. Some
#: quick examples to illustrate common tasks::

#:     # unmap a keyboard shortcut, passing it to the program running in kitty
#:     map kitty_mod+space
#:     # completely ignore a keyboard event
#:     map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
#:     # combine multiple actions
#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
#:     # multi-key shortcuts
#:     map ctrl+x>ctrl+y>z action

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.
